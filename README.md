* **Solar Flux Reborn**
    * Allows all solar panels to apply the "photovoltaic" modifier
* **Thaumcraft**
    * Adds thaumium, void metal, and primordial materials
    * Allows infusion enchantment of Tinkers' Construct equipment
    * Adds thaumonomicon entries explaining these mechanics

    * Adds support to the magma crucible for smeltery melting recipes
    * Allows flux capacitors to apply the "fluxed" modifier

In addition, Tinkers' Evolution also adds these features:

* Sceptres: magical weapons that can both strike things at close range or launch volleys of projectiles
* Modifiers: a few tool mods that aren't linked to a particular integration module
    * Fluxed Modifier: allows tools to run on energy by attaching a battery
    * Photovoltaic Modifier: gives energized tools the ability to recharge under the sun
* Artifacts: powerful tools and weapons that appear in loot chests but cannot be repaired
* Tweaks: small, configurable changes to basic Tinkers' Construct behaviour
    * Melt speed multiplier: a multiplier applied to melting speeds for all heat-based devices (e.g. smeltery, melter)
    * Disable damage cap: disables the tool damage cap mechanic, so tools can have arbitrarily large damage stats
